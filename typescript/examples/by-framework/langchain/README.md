# Langchain Agent
## 🚀 Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to use GOAT to allow a [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) agent to **send and receive ETH and ERC-20 tokens** on EVM networks. This example uses [Base Sepolia](https://base.org) but you can implement it with any other EVM network by changing the chain and RPC URL.

You can use this example with any other agent framework, chain, and wallet of your choice.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat.git && cd goat
```

2. Run the following commands from the `typescript` directory:
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

3. Go to the example directory:
```bash
cd examples/by-framework/langchain
```

4. Copy the `.env.template` and populate with your values:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `RPC_PROVIDER_URL`

5. Add some test funds to your wallet by going to any [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia). You can also trade

## Usage
1. Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm ts-node index.ts
```

2. Chat with the agent:
- Check your balance for ERC-20 tokens
- Send ERC-20 tokens to another address
- Check your balance again to see the tokens you just sent

## Using in production
In production, developers require advanced wallet setups that utilize [smart wallets](https://docs.goat-sdk.com/concepts/smart-wallets), which allow them to:
1. **Increase security** by setting programmable permissions (e.g. limiting fund amounts, restricting contract interactions, and defining required signatures)
2. **Maintain regulatory compliance** by ensuring agent wallets are non-custodial. This means that:
     - Launchpads, wallet providers, or agent platforms never have access to agents' wallets.
     - Agent platforms do not require money transmitter licenses.

### Agent Wallets
[Crossmint](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets) offers one of the most advanced solutions for agent developers and launchpads: [Agent Wallets](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets).
