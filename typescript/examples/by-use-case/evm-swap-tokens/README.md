# Swap tokens on EVM
## ðŸš€ Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to use GOAT to **swap ERC-20 tokens on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)** on EVM networks. This example uses [Base](https://base.org) but you can implement it with any other EVM network by changing the chain and RPC URL.

You can use this example with any other agent framework, chain, and wallet of your choice. You can also use other swap providers like [0x](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/plugins/0x), [Balancer](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/plugins/balancer) and [KIM](https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/packages/plugins/kim) by changing the plugin.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat.git && cd goat
```

2. Run the following commands from the `typescript` directory:
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

3. Go to the example directory:
```bash
cd examples/by-use-case/evm-swap-tokens
```

4. Copy the `.env.template` and populate with your values:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `RPC_PROVIDER_URL`

The Uniswap API will be populated already with values you can use for testing. To get your own production ready Uniswap API key, go to [Uniswap Hub](https://hub.uniswap.org/).

## Usage
1. Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm ts-node index.ts
```

2. Chat with the agent:
- Swap USDC for PEPE
- Swap PEPE for USDC
- Check your balance again to see the tokens you just swapped

## Using in production
In production, developers require advanced wallet setups that utilize [smart wallets](https://docs.goat-sdk.com/concepts/smart-wallets), which allow them to:
1. **Increase security** by setting programmable permissions (e.g. limiting fund amounts, restricting contract interactions, and defining required signatures)
2. **Maintain regulatory compliance** by ensuring agent wallets are non-custodial. This means that:
     - Launchpads, wallet providers, or agent platforms never have access to agents' wallets.
     - Agent platforms do not require money transmitter licenses.

### Agent Wallets
[Crossmint](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets) offers one of the most advanced solutions for agent developers and launchpads: [Agent Wallets](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets).

To integrate Agent Wallets with GOAT, check out the following quickstarts:
