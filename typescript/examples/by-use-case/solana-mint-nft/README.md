# Mint an NFT on Solana
## ðŸš€ Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to use GOAT to **mint an NFT on Solana** using [Crossmint](https://www.crossmint.com/). It also includes the ability to create a wallets for X/Twitter users and emails and drop NFTs into those wallets.

You can use this example with any other agent framework, chain, and wallet of your choice.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat.git && cd goat
```

2. Run the following commands from the `typescript` directory:
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

3. Go to the example directory:
```bash
cd examples/by-use-case/solana-mint-nft
```

4. Copy the `.env.template` and populate with your values:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SOLANA_RPC_URL`
- `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `CROSSMINT_API_KEY` - Use staging key for development, production key for mainnet

## Usage
1. Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm ts-node index.ts
```

2. Chat with the agent:
- Create a wallet for an X/Twitter user or email
- Mint an NFT to the wallet

3. To use the production key, set the `CROSSMINT_API_KEY` environment variable to your production key and change the chain to a mainnet chain.

## Using in production
In production, developers require advanced wallet setups that utilize [smart wallets](https://docs.goat-sdk.com/concepts/smart-wallets), which allow them to:
1. **Increase security** by setting programmable permissions (e.g. limiting fund amounts, restricting contract interactions, and defining required signatures)
2. **Maintain regulatory compliance** by ensuring agent wallets are non-custodial. This means that:
     - Launchpads, wallet providers, or agent platforms never have access to agents' wallets.
     - Agent platforms do not require money transmitter licenses.

### Agent Wallets
[Crossmint](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets) offers one of the most advanced solutions for agent developers and launchpads: [Agent Wallets](https://docs.crossmint.com/wallets/quickstarts/agent-wallets).
